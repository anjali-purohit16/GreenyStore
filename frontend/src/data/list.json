  "title":"An overwatered pot creates the perfect habitat for pests and fungal problems. Fungus gnats are tiny, mosquito-like insects that lay their eggs in moist soil. While the adults are more of a nuisance than a threat, their larvae feed on organic matter and tender roots, further weakening the plant.Mould or algae on the soil surface, especially white, fuzzy growths, is another sign of excess moisture and poor air circulation. Both conditions suggest the soil is staying wet for too long and needs time to dry out between waterings.",

  "title":" Perhaps the most confusing sign of overwatering is wilting that occurs even when the soil is damp. This happens because damaged roots are no longer able to absorb water, causing the plant to appear dehydrated despite having plenty of moisture around its roots.\n If a once-thriving plant stops producing new leaves or shows signs of droopiness without dry soil, overwatering should be considered as a likely cause. In such cases, repotting and careful trimming of dead roots may be required. ",

  "title":"Addressing overwatering begins with adjusting your watering habits. Start by letting the top two inches of soil dry out fully before each watering. Grouping plants by water needs can help prevent over-attention to species that prefer dry conditions. Use pots with proper drainage holes and avoid decorative planters without outlets unless they contain an inner pot with drainage. Selecting a potting mix that suits your plant type (fast-draining for cacti, moisture-retentive for ferns) makes a difference too. Let the plantâ€™s leaves and soil texture guide you.Overwatering is a common misstep, but also one of the most correctable. ",
